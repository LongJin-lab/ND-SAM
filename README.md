# Cifar10 with WRN üåÅ

This folder contains a NDSAM optimizer implementation that can be trained on Cifar100 and Cifar10. 

Start the training with NDSAM on ResNet18 by running `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train2.py --arch r18`
Start the training with original SAM on ResNet18 by running `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python3 train.py --arch r18`
